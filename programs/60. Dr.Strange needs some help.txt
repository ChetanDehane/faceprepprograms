strange genes which will make him the most powerful sorcerer in the existence . He needs to create 
particular amount of bacteria. The bacteria multiplies exponentially. If he lets m bacteria to multiply n 
exponential times, he should check whether he will get the required amount of bacteria.
Input consists of three inputs. The no. of bacteria, m. The number in which it gets multiplied, n. 
The required number, req .

Input (stdin)
2
3
7

Output (stdout)

Doctor, you can proceed with your experiment.

program:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int mul(int, int);
int main()
{
  int m,n,s,req;
  cin>>m>>n>>req;
  if(req<=mul(m,n))
    cout<<"Doctor, you can proceed with your experiment.";
  else
    cout<<"Sorry Doctor! You need more bacteria.";
  return 0;
}
int mul(int a,int b)
{
   int c=1;
  while(b!=0)
  {
    c=c*a;
    b--;
  }
  return c;
}
