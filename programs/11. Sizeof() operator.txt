Sizeof() operator
Maya is interested to learn programming languages. When she is learning, she had a doubt 
on how to find the size of the variable. In C++, we have the sizeof() operator, 
which is used to get the size occupied by a variable or value. 
Now, write a C++ program to declare a variable of character, integer, float, and 
double type and print their respective sizes.
OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print the corresponding size of a character, integer, float and double.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

1

4

4

8


program:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
 cout<<sizeof(char)<<"\n"<<sizeof(int)<<"\n"<<sizeof(float)<<"\n"<<sizeof(double);
 return 0;
}
