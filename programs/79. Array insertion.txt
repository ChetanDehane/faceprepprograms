Array insertion

Arun and Ram were playing cards. Arun has 5 cards. Ram wants to insert a new card in between Arun's cards. 
Ram wants to find the position to insert the card. So help him to find the position to insert a certain card. 
If Ram inserts a card in a position other than the position of 5 cards, the game will be over. So play carefully. 
EXAMPLE: For example, consider an array having three elements in it initially and a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2 and a[2] = 3 
and you want to insert a number 45 at location 1 i.e. a[0] = 45, so we have to move elements one step below after 
insertion a[1] = 1 , and a[2] = 2 and a[3] = 3.

Input & Output Format:

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Sample Input:

Enter the number of elements in the array

5

Enter the elements in the array

1

2

3

4

5

Enter the location where you wish to insert an element

4

Enter the value to insert

10

Sample Output:

Array after insertion is

1

2

3

10

4

5



program:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int i,n,no,no_val;
  cout<<"Enter the number of elements in the array"<<endl;
  cin>>n;
  int a[n];
  cout<<"Enter the elements in the array"<<endl;
  for(i=0;i<n;i++)
  {
    cin>>a[i];
  }
  cout<<"Enter the location where you wish to insert an element"<<endl;
  cin>>no;
  if(no>n)
  {
    cout<<"Invalid Input"<<endl;
    return 0;
  }
  cout<<"Enter the value to insert"<<endl;
  cin>>no_val;
  cout<<"Array after insertion is"<<endl;
  n++;
  for(i=n;i>=no;i--)
  {
    a[i]=a[i-1];
  }
  a[no-1]=no_val;
  
  for(i=0;i<n;i++)
  {
    cout<<a[i]<<endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
