Cricket

Tom is crazy about cricket. He was watching India vs. Australia World cup final match. 
Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. They finished batting with a score of X. 
Next, India started to bat and scored Y runs in N number of balls. As Tom is very crazy, 
he wants to calculate the run rate and check whether there is a probability for India to 
win or not. Help him calculate the run-rate and check the probability.
