Reverse Number

Need to design a program wherein when the human enters an integer, 
the computer should return an integer in the reversed manner. 
Write a program to calculate the reverse of the given number.
Note: Take care of the leading zeros (e.g. 5200 gives 25). 
It means reversed number never has any trailing zeros.

Sample Input:

4235

Sample Output:

5324

program:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
  int n,a;
  cin>>n;
  while(n>0)
  {
   a=n%10;
    if(a==0)
    {
      n=n/10;
    }
    else
    {
       cout<<a;               // instead of cout<<a statement when can use
        n=n/10;               // sum=sum*10+a;  for this we have to declare
    }                         //  sum as a int sum=0  and for result we have 
                              //  to print sum outside the loop.
    
    
  }
	return 0;
