Age Detector


Ask a user for his/her birth year encoded as two digits (like "62") and for the current 
year, also encoded as two digits (like "99"). Write a program to find the users current 
age in years.

INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 2 integers.

The first integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the birth year.

The second integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the current year.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print the user's current age.

Refer below sample output for formatting.

SAMPLE INPUT:

62

00

inputs:

case 1          case 2          case 3
62              01              80
00              07              32



program:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int birth_year,current_year;
  cin>>birth_year>>current_year;
  int age=(current_year+2000)-(birth_year+1900);
  int age1=(current_year+2000)-(birth_year+2000);
  if(age>0&&age<=100)
    {
  cout<<age;
    }
  else 
    cout<<age1;
  return 0;
  }
