Complex number calculator

Ryan is appearing for a techathon that offers price money of 10K for the winner. Techathon has provided a platform 
where an incomplete code will appear, and the participants have to complete it. Ryan got a program where he needs 
to create a complex calculator. Can you help Ryan win this competition?

The first line consists of a choice which is an integer to choose from 1 to 3. 
Choice 1 represents addition of two complex numbers, 2 represents subtraction of two complex numbers and 
3 represents the multiplication of two complex numbers.
