Sece dining


The catering staff in the SECE mess are known for their good cooking skills as well as 
hospitality. We all know that the dining table arrangement needs to be different for left
handed and right handed persons. So whenever any VIP guest visits SECE, they would make 
the table arrangements based on whether he/she is left handed or right handed. The mess 
is situated on the 15th floor of the hostel building. SECE hostel building has superfast 
elevators to help travel from one floor to another. Each elevator has 2 doors, the front 
one and the rear one. If a person enters the elevator through the front door, he goes out 
through the rear door and vice-versa. The elevator has 2 rails numbered as 1 and 2. 
Rail 1 is located to the left of the entrance of the front door 
(or correspondingly, to the right of the entrance of the rear door). 
Rail 2 is located opposite it, to the right of the entrance of the front door and to the 
left of the entrance of the rear door. We know that each person holds on the rail with 
his/her strongest hand. There is an IP camera in the elevator and based on the camera 
output, the catering staff will be easily able to identify whether a guest is left handed
or right handed. They have decided to automate this task and they asked the help of Image
Processing Group. The Image Processing Group has written a program to perform this task 
and the program will output the door through which the person entered and the rail number
which the person held. Based on this input, write a program to determine whether a person
is left handed or right handed.
INPUT FORMAT:

The first input is a string to denote the door as “front” or “rear”.

The second input is an integer to denote the rail as 1 or 2.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print the string "Left Handed" or "Right Handed".

SAMPLE INPUT:

front

1

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

Left Handed


program:

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  string door;
  int rail;
  cin>>door>>rail;
  if(door=="front")
  {
    if(rail==1)
    {
      cout<<"Left Handed";
    }
    else if(rail==2)
    {
      cout<<"Right Handed";
    }
  }
  else if(door=="rear")
  {
    if(rail==2)
    {
      cout<<"Left Handed";
    }
    else if(rail==1)
    {
      cout<<"Right Handed";
    }
  }
  
 
  return 0;
}
