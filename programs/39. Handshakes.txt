with each other when they meet. If there are n number of students in the class then 
find the total number of handshakes made by the students.

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 1 integer. First input corresponds to the total number of students.

using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int total_st,i,sum=0;
  cin>>total_st;                    
  for(i=1;i<=total_st-1;i++)            // formula for handshake n=(total_st*(total_st-1))/2         
  {
    sum=sum+i;
  }
  cout<<sum;
  return 0;
