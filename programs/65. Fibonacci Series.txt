Fibonacci Series

Write a program to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series using recursion. 
Note that the first 2 terms in the Fibonacci Series are 0 and 1.

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of an integer.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

All text in bold corresponds to the input and the rest corresponds to output.

SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT:

5

The term 5 in the fibonacci series is 3


program:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int fib(int n)
{
  if(n<=1)
    return n;
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
  
}
  
int main()
{
  int n;
  cin>>n;
  fib(n);
  cout<<"The term "<<n<<" in the fibonacci series is "<<fib(n-1);
  return 0;
}
