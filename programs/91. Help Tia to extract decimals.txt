Help Tia to extract decimals

Tia is new to programming. She needs to write a program which will receive the input as a floating point number. 
She needs to print the decimal part of the floating point of the number. She has written a few lines of code. 
Can you fill up the rest.
Read the input as string. Use string operations on the input to derive the answer easily.

Input (stdin)
-955.444

Output (stdout)
Floating part is : 444


program:

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
int main() 
{ 
	std::string fnum;
	getline(std::cin,fnum);
    int found=fnum.find(".");
    int f1=fnum.length();
    std::string str;
    str.assign(fnum.begin()+found+1,fnum.end());
    std::cout<<"Floating part is : "<<str;
}
