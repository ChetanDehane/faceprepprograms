Stick games I

After winning gold and silver in Indian Computing Olympiad 2014, Arun Gupta and Mani Iyer want to have some fun. 
Now they are playing a game on a grid made of n horizontal and m vertical sticks. Let us assume a grid where, 
n = 3 and m = 3. There are n + m = 6 sticks in total. There are n*m = 9 intersection points, numbered from 1 to 9.
The rules of the game are very simple. The players move in turns. Arun Gupta won gold, so he makes the first move. 
During his/her move, a player must choose any remaining intersection point and remove from the grid all sticks 
which pass through this point. A player will lose the game if he cannot make a move 
(i.e. there are no intersection points remaining on the grid at his move). 
Assume that both players play optimally. Who will win the game? FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: void print(int);

Input Format:

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, n, and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

Output Format:

Print a single line containing "Arun Gupta" or "Mani Iyer" (without the quotes), depending on the winner of the game.

Sample Input:

 2 2

Sample Output:

 Mani Iyer


program:

#include<iostream>

        cout <<"Arun Gupta";
    }
}
int main()
{
    int n, m, res;
    cin >> n >> m;
    if(n < m)
    {
        res = n;

    else
    {
        res = m;
    }

    return 0;
