Check you typing speed!


Cicily is organizing a typing competition. Each participant who clears the competition 
receives a certificate and a cash prize. The initial mark is ten. For each mistake made, 
one mark is reduced. If the participant's score is an absolute value, he/she will be 
rewarded. Can you help Cicily to write a program where she enters the id of a participant 
and the score obtained, and the program should print the result for that candidate.
Id and marks is of integer type.

program:

#include<iostream>
int main()
{
  int sd_id,marks;
  std::cin>>sd_id>>marks;
  if(marks>0)
  {
    std::cout<<sd_id<<" is eligible for reward.";
  
}
  return 0;
