Sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers

Arun and Kalai were playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the odd and even 
numbers and find the sum of the odd numbers and the sum of the even numbers. Write a program to help them 
to solve the puzzle game and to win the mobile phone.

Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. 

The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. 

Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:

Refer to sample output for details.

Sample Input:

5

2

3

6

8

-1

Sample Output:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2


program:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void sum(int *a,int n)
{
  int i,sumofeven=0,sumofodd=0;
  for(i=0;i<n;i++)
  {
    if(a[i]%2==0)
    {
      sumofeven=sumofeven+a[i];
    }
    else
    {
      sumofodd=sumofodd+a[i];
    }
  }
  cout<<"The sum of the even numbers in the array is "<<sumofeven<<endl;
  cout<<"The sum of the odd numbers in the array is "<<sumofodd;
}

int main()
{
  int n,i;
  cin>>n;
  int a[n];
  for(i=0;i<n;i++)
  {
    cin>>a[i];
  }
  sum(a,n);
  return 0;
}
